## Complex proteomic rearrangements in response to vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deprivation and heat stress in the polar diatom, *F. cylindrus*

### Summary

* Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is a scarce cobalt-containing micronutrient that impacts phytoplankton growth in the Southern Ocean and globally. B<sub>12</sub> deprivation leads to metabolic consequences in diatoms and has been implicated in heat stress responses in other algae.  Here we explore the interactive effects of B<sub>12</sub> starvation and heat stress on protein expression in the ecologically significant SO diatom, <i>Fragilariopsis cylindrus. </i>
* <i>F. cylindrus</i> was grown in B<sub>12</sub>-deplete medium and exposed to lethal temperatures. Targeted and global quantitative proteomic analyses were used to identify the molecular consequences of the two stressors. 
* We found that growth was unaffected by B<sub>12</sub> availability at lethal temperatures, despite complex proteomic rearrangements in response to the combined stressors. Amongst these rearrangements, we identify proteins that may be used to remodel degraded B12. 
* This study is the first to examine the proteomic response of a psychrophilic diatom to B<sub>12</sub> starvation and elevated temperatures. We demonstrate that canonical B<sub>12</sub> starvation and heat responses persist under these stressors combined, suggesting that proteomic biomarkers historically used to survey B<sub>12</sub> limitation in diatoms are reliable under heat stress. The differential expression of proteins used to respond to B<sub>12</sub> deprivation is evidence that B<sub>12</sub> can impose selective pressure on Southern Ocean diatoms.
